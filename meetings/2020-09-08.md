### Discussion Items

#### Unification Update

Brian Warner shared an update regarding unification with the Presto Software Foundation. Work is still in progress to merge the communities, and discussions are ongoing assessing differences between the technologies, and how the technologies may merge. 

#### Outreach Committee Update

Dipti Borkar, the outreach committee chairperson, shared an update from the outreach committee. The outreach committee is hosting monthly meetups, and has seen strong interest with 100+ attendees per session. Dipti encouraged the TSC to offer talks or send requests/suggestions for talks to the outreach committee. Dipti also shared an update about PrestoCon. The event is on September 24, 2020 and registration is open. There are many speakers lined up, but there is a gap in diversity. The TSC may reach the outreach committee at outreach@lists.prestodb.io.
