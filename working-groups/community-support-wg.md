# Presto Community Support Working Group Governance
*
This document describes the basic governance principles for the Presto Community Support Working Group (the “Community Support WG”).

The Community Support WG operates as a working group under the [Presto Technical Charter](https://github.com/prestodb/foundation/blob/main/Presto%20Technical%20Charter%2020191015.pdf), which describes the responsibilities of the Presto Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”). The Community Support WG is established by the TSC as a working group pursuant to the Technical Charter. Accordingly, the Community Support WG will operate in accordance with the Technical Charter and Presto’s other policies and procedures, supplemented by the details below.

## Purpose

Measure and coordinate the Presto technical community's support and maintenance.

## Scope

* Establish metrics to measure community health and support.  Report such metrics periodically to the TSC.
* Determine where additional investment from the TSC needs to be made based on the above established metrics.
* Spend time to help mentor and grow community members into productive committers.
* Spend time to help answer questions on Slack, Github issues, and Stack Overflow.

## Principles

* **Openness** and **Transparency**:
  * Meetings of the Community Support WG shall be open to all participants who are dedicated to supporting the Presto community.
  * Decisions of the Community Support WG will be discussed openly in meetings, mailing list discussions, and/or issue threads.
* **Neutrality**:
  * The Community Support WG should operate in a manner which prioritizes the best interests of the Presto project ecosystem as a whole, and which does not privilege any particular vendor or distributor of Presto-related goods and services.
  * All activities of the Community Support WG shall comply at all times with the [Antitrust Policy of The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/).
* **Technical merit**:
  * Decisions on what is included in, or excluded from, the performance metrics should be based on technical merit, in light of the goals of aligning with the Presto project codebase and fitting with reasonable expectations of end users of Presto.
  * Participants in discussions should have the opportunity to share, discuss and advocate for the merit of their views. However, not all views will necessarily be followed or implemented.
* **Objectivity**:
  * To the extent possible, performance metrics should be based on objectively-measurable criteria, rather than subjective considerations requiring personal evaluation and determination.

## Governance
* **Working Group**:
  * The TSC is establishing the Community Support WG as a working group of the TSC, pursuant to section 2(h)(iv) of the Presto Technical Charter.
* **Chairperson**:
  * The TSC will appoint an initial Chairperson of the Community Support WG.
  * The TSC may, in its discretion, remove the Chairperson and/or appoint a new Chairperson of the Community Support WG.
  * The current Chairperson will be listed on the [Community Support Program Working Group Github Project](https://github.com/prestodb/community-support-wg).
  * The Chairperson shall be responsible for:
    * scheduling regular meetings of the Community Support WG community;
    * facilitating open discussion among Community Support WG community participants;
    * assisting the Community Support WG community to seek to reach consensus;
    * recording decisions that are reached by the Community Support WG community;
    * documenting areas of disagreement where consensus cannot be reached, for escalation to the TSC; and
    * keeping the TSC regularly informed about the status of the Community Support WG’s efforts.
  * The Chairperson shall not be responsible for:
    * deciding the outcome of technical decisions if consensus cannot be reached.
* **Meetings**:
  * Participants in the meetings shall comply with the [Presto Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and all other policies of the Presto Foundation and The Linux Foundation.
* **Decisions**:
  * The Community Support WG aims to operate as a consensus-based community.
  * If there are any decisions where consensus cannot be reached, the Chairperson may escalate the decision to the TSC to resolve the decision according to the Technical Charter.
* **Amendments**:
  * The TSC may, in its discretion, amend this Working Group Governance document from time to time.
