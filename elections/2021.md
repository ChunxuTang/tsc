### Please provide 2-3 sentences on your involvement in the Presto project

I'm one of the major maintainers and contributors of quite a few presto connectors/modules such as iceberg, druid and caching.

I am also actively promoting presto in the open source community.

### Please provide 3-6 sentences on what you aspire to achieve on the TSC

1. Promote presto as a major compute engine besides spark and flink for datalakes (iceberg and hudi)
2. Promote presto to the field of sub-second computing jobs (with caching, druid-connector and etc.)
3. Let more excellent developers join the prestodb community, this is actually what I have been doing, and have some results
4. Make presto easier to use and reduce the burden of maintenance -- I'm working on a new tool to manage and visualize the running presto cluster which would be open sourced later.

Yes

### Please provide 2-3 sentences on your involvement in the Presto project

- Working closely with core Presto developers (including @kewang1024, @yuanzhanhku and @jainxrohit) on data caching in Hive Connector. Examples include improving & maintaining production deployment at Facebook, creating guidelines for debugging and diagnosing this feature, keeping closer Alluxio integration with Presto to enable new use cases (e.g., adding quota #15681, cache eviction policies #15774 and etc)
- Leading and working with researchers from Princeton University and Nanjing University, proposed and still experimenting new probabilistic algorithms to enhance insights into Presto workload (initial results presented by collaborators from Princeton & Facebook) 
- Serving in both Presto board and Presto Outreach committee for various duties; also presented Presto related use cases in different companies (e.g., Shopee, iQiyi), hosting a bi-weekly community developer sync on Presto+Alluxio users (link) and etc

### Please provide 3-6 sentences on what you aspire to achieve on the TSC

As the co-chair of the Alluxio open source community and long-time contributor to the Presto community, I really want to deepen the integration and collaboration between these two communities --- two open-source technologies combined to improve user experience. As a TSC member, it is easier for me to keep expanding the impact and influence of Presto in the Alluxio community e.g., I always recommend Presto for Alluxio users for a better experience of OLAP queries. Similarly, I could also leverage my experience and knowledge in Alluxio to improve Presto especially the Hive connector for better performance.

### Do you currently hold any formal leadership roles within the Presto community?

- Presto TSC member/committer
- Presto board member (representing Alluxio)
- Presto outreach committee member (representing Alluxio)

### Do you commit to attending the monthly TSC calls?

Yes I attended each monthly TSC call since 2020 and will continue in the future.
